I tried to find an extension to solve my problem and ended up find [this](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1568/notification-banner-positionselenium-h/).

I decided to improve but couldn't find the extension's repository, so I created mine.

> **Note**: as per feedback, there's, indeed, a good extensions that does what I want. It's called [Panel OSD](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/708/panel-osd/).
